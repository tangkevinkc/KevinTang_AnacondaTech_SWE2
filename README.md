Kevin Tang Anaconda Technical Assessment SWE2

Technical Assessment - Software Engineer II, Packaging

____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Requirements:

Write a program that takes a pair of directories as input and writes out three files as output.
 
  1. A file named 'common', which contains files that are identical in both the first and second
    directories.
  
  2. Files a_only and b_only, which contains the files that are only in the first directory ('a')
    and those that are only in the second directory ('b')
   
  A file is considered identical if its contents are byte-for-byte identical (name, permissions, and
  location don't matter).
 
  Expect that this will be run on very large directory trees (100,000 files).

Instructions:

  1. The maximum time we suggest spending on this assignment is four hours.
  
  2. Use C or C++. Please tell us which standard compiler (+version) you used.
  
  3. Ensure the following tasks exist and are automated via Makefile or another tool of your
      choice:
      
        - build
        - clean
        - test
        - run
  
  4. Build an executable with an accompanying shared library. The executable has to link
    against the shared library. You donâ€™t need to upload the binaries.
  
  5. Your project should include testing at the level you find appropriate. Be prepared to
    discuss your testing choices.
  
  6. You can use Linux, Windows, or macOS. Please tell us what platform you used.
  
  7. You are free to use third-party or external dependencies. If you use a third-party
    dependency, please provide us with the instructions on where we can find it and how to
    build it (if possible):
      
      - Do not use one that will do everything for you. We want to see if you know C or C++.
    
      - The md5sum utility might be useful.
